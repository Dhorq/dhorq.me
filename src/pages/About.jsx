          Since my fifth semester at university, I have specialized in Data
          Analytics. I later gained internship experience as a System Analyst at
          KEMENKEU and Data Analyst at DPR.

        <p className="leading-8">
          After graduating, I became interested in Data Engineering and pursued
          it through self-directed learning, as I wanted to further advance my
          coding abilities and technical skills. I continued this learning
          journey until June
        </p>
        <p className="leading-8">
          Since July, I have taken a deliberate step to into a self-taught Full
          Stack Developer role, driven by my passion for problem-solving and
          building meaningful solutions. I have remained consistent in this path
          and continue to deepen my skills and experience up to the present.
